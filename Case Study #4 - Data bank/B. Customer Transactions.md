# B. Customer Transactions ðŸ’°
## Questions with solutions and logic ðŸ“–
## 1. What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?
```sql
SELECT txn_type, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) , SUM(txn_amount) 
FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
GROUP BY txn_type;
```
Answer:
transaction_type | count | total_amount 
--- | --- | ---
deposit | 500 | 1359168
purchase | 448 | 806537
withdrawal | 439 | 793003

- Logic: We have used GROUP BY to collect the count and sum as per the transaction type and then used COUNT(DISTINCT) and SUM to get unique values as well as the sum.
## 2. What is the average total historical deposit counts and amounts for all customers?
```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(sum_deposit),2) , COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) 
FROM (
  SELECT customer_id, SUM(txn_amount) AS sum_deposit 
  FROM data_bank.customer_transactions 
  WHERE txn_type = 'deposit'
  GROUP BY customer_id
  ) AS deposit_amount;
```
- Answer: The average historical deposits are 2718.34 for the customers
- Logic: We have used subquery to calculate sum of all the customer where the transaction type is deposit . After calculating the sum we have calculated the average to understand the average total historical deposit. We had to use a subquery as we aggregate functions cannot be nested in SQL.
## 3. For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal in a single month?
```sql
WITH count_txn_type AS (
SELECT customer_id, EXTRACT ( MONTH FROM txn_date ) as mth, 
 	SUM (CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS deposit_count,
	SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type ='purchase' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'withdrawal' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS withdrawal_count
FROM data_bank.customer_transactions 
GROUP BY customer_id, EXTRACT ( MONTH FROM txn_date ))
SELECT mth, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM count_txn_type 
WHERE deposit_count > 1 AND purchase_count >= 1 OR withdrawal_count >=1
GROUP BY mth
ORDER BY mth;
```
- Answer :

month | count
--- | ---
1|246
2|337
3|354
4|171

- Logic: In this problem , we have first used CASE WHEN to get the total sum of the customers who have done deposits, purchase or withdrawal with the help of CTE. After that, I have used WHERE to get only those customers whose sum of deposits is more than 1 AND purchase OR withdrwal is 1 . The sum was a complex one but breaking it down with CTEs helped!
