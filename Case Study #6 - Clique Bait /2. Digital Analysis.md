## Questions with solutions and logic ðŸ“–
## 1. How many users are there?
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM clique_bait.users;
```
- Answer: 500
## 2. How many cookies does each user have on average?
```sql
WITH CTE AS ( 
    SELECT user_id, COUNT(cookie_id) AS count_cookie FROM clique_bait.users
    GROUP BY user_id)
    
 SELECT ROUND(AVG(count_cookie),0) FROM CTE;
 ```
- Each user has around 4 cookies on average
- In this solution we have used CTE to get the count of cookie id and then grouped it by users . After getting the count we have used AVG to get the average of the count of customer_id.
## 3. What is the unique number of visits by all users per month?
```sql
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', event_time) AS month_start, COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id ) FROM clique_bait.events
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month' , event_time);
```

- We have used DATE_TRUNC function to extract the first day of each month and then grouped by on the basis of the date
## 4. What is the number of events for each event type?
```sql
SELECT event_type, COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id) AS number_of_events FROM clique_bait.events 
GROUP BY event_type;
```
- Answer :

Event Type | Number_of_events
--- | ---
1 | 3564
2 | 2510
3 | 1777
4 | 876
5 | 702
## 5. What is the percentage of visits which have a purchase event?
```sql
SELECT 100 * COUNT(DISTINCT events.visit_id ) / (SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT visit_id)FROM clique_bait.events) AS purchase_percentage
FROM clique_bait.events JOIN clique_bait.event_identifier
ON events.event_type = event_identifier.event_type
WHERE event_identifier.event_name = 'Purchase';
```
- Around 49 % of the visits had a purchase event.
## 6. What is the percentage of visits which view the checkout page but do not have a purchase event?
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT events.visit_id)*100/(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT events.visit_id ) FROM clique_bait.events) AS percentage_checkout_visits
FROM clique_bait.events JOIN clique_bait.event_identifier 
ON events.event_type = event_identifier.event_type
JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy ON 
events.page_id = page_hierarchy.page_id
WHERE page_hierarchy.page_name = 'Checkout' AND event_identifier.event_name != 'Purchase';
```
- The percentage of views is 59%
## 7. What are the top 3 pages by number of views?
```sql
SELECT page_hierarchy.page_name, COUNT(DISTINCT events.visit_id ) FROM clique_bait.events
JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy ON
events.page_id = page_hierarchy.page_id
GROUP BY page_hierarchy.page_name
ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT events.visit_id ) DESC
LIMIT 3;
```
- Answer:
  page_name | count
  --- | ---
  All Products | 3174
  Checkout | 2103
  HomePage | 1782
## 8. What is the number of views and cart adds for each product category?
```sql
SELECT event_identifier.event_name, COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id)
FROM clique_bait.events JOIN clique_bait.event_identifier ON
events.event_type = event_identifier.event_type
WHERE events.event_type = 1 OR events.event_type = 2
GROUP BY event_identifier.event_name;
```
- Answer:

event_name | count
--- | ---
Add to Cart | 2510
